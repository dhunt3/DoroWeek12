I help patrons all the time with computer questions. Most patrons do not know how to use a computer so I have to explain things in a way they would understand. I explain things to them step by step, explaining what I am doing and why I am doing it.



I like the staff events we do. I like it when an employer tries to keep up morale and keep us motivated to help others. I do not like how the environment can become uncomfortable when certain patrons come in the building being demanding and hostile.



I love arts and crafts and yoga. It helps me keep a cool head and gives me a creative outlet.



I enjoy any project that allows me to be creative and that also meets the requirements of the person that assigned me the project. I don't really have a favorite project, off the top of my head.



I truly dislike it when I cannot reach a project's goal or time frame. I do not like feeling like I failed or lost control of the situation. I always try to take a step back and start fresh if I need to.



I can understand the need of letting off steam. Working to the bone to reach a deadline can be hard on you physically and mentally. I would just find a quiet place for me to finish my work. If it happens a lot, I would mention it to our facilitator.
